# Monto services for the Haskell language

This repository includes the following services:

* [Tokenizer](src/Tokens.hs), derived from the parsing side product of GHC
* [AST](src/AST.hs), directly generated by the GHC `parseModule` function
* [Type Errors](src/ErrorMessages.hs), generated by the GHC `typecheckModule` function
* [Outline](src/Outline.hs), generated by trimming the AST of `parseModule`
